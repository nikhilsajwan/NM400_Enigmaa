## Contributions are welcome to the Baresip project

The preferred way to contribute is via a Pull Request (PR).

* The PR should be small and logical and solve a concrete problem.
  If your code is very large then please split it into smaller PRs.

* The code must be tested on your platform. If the code involves
  SIP signaling or interop, it should also be tested against
  3rd party SIP endpoints.

* The code must compile with zero warnings

* The code must pass "make ccheck"

* Doxygen comments is nice to add, but it is not mandatory
